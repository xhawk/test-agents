# test-agents

Lightweight Python utilities and example agents for testing and experimentation. This repository contains small, focused components useful for building, testing, and validating agent-like behavior in Python projects.

## Contents
- Example agents and helpers (unit-test oriented)
- Test harnesses and example scenarios
- Small, dependency-light implementations intended for experimentation

## Quick start

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

2. Install dependencies if a `pyproject.toml` exists:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

## Usage
- Browse the examples to see agent patterns and test cases.
- Reuse small utilities to scaffold your own agent experiments or CI tests.

## Contributing
Contributions, issues, and suggestions are welcome. Please open an issue to discuss larger changes or submit a pull request with a clear description and tests where applicable.

## Notes
This repo is primarily Python (100%) and intended as a compact workspace for experimenting with testable agent code and patterns.
